# Week 1 Summary

## What Week 1 Covered
In week 1, I learned how to set up Python, use GitHub, and write basic Python scripts. 
I practiced variables, loops, functions, and started using OpenCV for computer vision.

## What OpenCV Does
OpenCV is a computer vision library that helps computers see and process images and videos.
It allows loading images, converting colors, and working with frames like a video.

## What Images Are as Arrays
An image is a grid of numbers.
Each pixel is stored as values in an array that represent color intensity.
The computer reads these numbers to understand the image.
