# Day 07 — Grayscale + Understanding Images as Arrays

## What I did
- Converted image to grayscale
- Displayed grayscale image
- Updated README with Week 1 summary

## Commands run
- python image_loader.py

## New terms
- Grayscale: single-channel image
- Array: grid of pixel values

## Why this matters
Most CV models preprocess images (resize, grayscale, normalize) before detection (YOLO does this internally).
