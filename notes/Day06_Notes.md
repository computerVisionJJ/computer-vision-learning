# Day 06 — Load and Display Image with OpenCV

## What I did
- Added images folder
- Loaded an image with cv2.imread
- Displayed it using cv2.imshow

## Commands run
- python image_loader.py

## New terms
- OpenCV: computer vision library
- cv2.imread: loads image into memory as an array

## Why this matters
Every CV pipeline starts with loading image data correctly.
