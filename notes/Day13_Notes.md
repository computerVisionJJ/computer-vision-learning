# Day 13 – Blur + Edge Detection

Today I learned how to reduce noise in images using Gaussian blur and how to detect edges using Canny edge detection.

Blur helps smooth the image so edge detection works better.
Edges show the outlines of objects in an image.

These steps are used before detection models to improve accuracy.
