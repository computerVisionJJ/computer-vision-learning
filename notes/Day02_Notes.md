# Day 02 — Variables + Data Types

## What I did
- Created variables.py
- Used int, string, and boolean
- Ran the script and changed values

## Commands run
- python variables.py

## Code written
- Variables: age, name, learning_cv

## New terms
- Variable: stores data in memory
- Data types: int, string, boolean

## Why this matters
Computer vision models store images, labels, and configs in variables. This is foundational for all ML pipelines.
