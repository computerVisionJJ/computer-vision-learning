# Day 03 — Loops (Frame Thinking)

## What I did
- Created loops.py
- Used for-loops to simulate frames

## Commands run
- python loops.py

## New terms
- Loop: repeats code multiple times
- Iteration: each repeat cycle

## Why this matters
Video processing works frame-by-frame. Loops are how real CV systems process streams.
