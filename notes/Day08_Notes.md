# Day 08 Notes — Image Preprocessing Pipeline

## What I Did
- Loaded an image using OpenCV
- Validated the image loaded correctly
- Resized the image
- Saved the processed output to disk

## Commands Run
- python image_preprocess.py

## Code Written or Modified
- image_preprocess.py

##  Industry Terms 
- Preprocessing: Preparing raw images before using them in ML models
- Pipeline: A sequence of processing steps applied to data

## Why This Matters Jobs
 preprocessing step used before feeding images into object detection models like YOLO.
In production systems, engineers build pipelines that load, validate, transform, and save data reliably.
